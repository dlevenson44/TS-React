- This Repo contains a Counter app that was written once with React Hooks and a second time using Class based components to manage state
- Currently the version using React Hooks lives in the `src` folder, but you can rename that folder to something else-- ie `src-hooks`-- and then change the `src-hookless-counter` folder to `src` to run the Class based version.... they both look the exact same minus a tweak in the title
